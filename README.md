# react-native-secure-network

react-native-secure-network is a simple and reliable React Native library designed to assess the security of the device’s active network connection. It identifies whether the network is Wi-Fi or mobile data, checks if the Wi-Fi network is open or protected, and inspects the encryption type (such as WPA/WPA2). This allows developers to block or warn users when their device is connected to an insecure network.

## Installation


```sh
npm install react-native-secure-network
```


## Usage


```js
import { multiply } from 'react-native-secure-network';

// ...

const result = multiply(3, 7);
```
